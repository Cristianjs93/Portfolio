      Hi, I'm Cristian! My passion for programming began at the age of 11, when
      I started developing on a Compaq using Visual Basic and Visual C++. I
      studied civil engineering and worked in that field, but eventually, I
      rediscovered programming, a world I haven't left since. I am currently
      actively seeking new job opportunities that will allow me to continue
      growing as a developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among my achievements, I have <strong>led work teams</strong> to achieve results
      within established deadlines, as well as the <strong
        >development of ERP software for companies in various sectors</strong
      >, which has significantly contributed to improving their production and
      quality metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to positively transform the way we live through software
      development, leveraging my skills and knowledge to tackle bigger
      challenges and create innovative solutions that make a difference.
    </p>
